# 📧 AI-Based Spam Email Detection System

A machine learning project to detect spam emails using Natural Language Processing and classification models. This project was developed as part of **Assignment 102** to explore end-to-end model building, from data preprocessing to model evaluation and deployment.

## 🚀 Objective

To build an intelligent system that analyzes email content and metadata to classify messages as spam or not spam. The system utilizes NLP techniques and machine learning models to achieve high accuracy and interpretability.
